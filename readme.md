---
Included here are some experiements in utilising Oracle Cloud INfrastructure Free Tier.  This is great rsource for experimenting with differnet projects that require a reasonably powerful, always on platform.  

Its like being given two "Raspberry Pis in the sky".

If there's anything that you find useful, feel free to share!

Some examples I'm interested in working thorugh include:

* [Simple Data Science Development Platform.](https://github.com/petewinn/OCI-Free-Tier/tree/master/SimpleDS)
* Personal Cloud Services (using nextcloud).
* Personal VPN service.
* Media Service.

More will be added in the next few months in both this and sister repos under this username.
