# Run VS Code development environment on your iPad!

![VS Code on an iPAD!](/Assets/vscode-ipad.jpg)

Sometimes your travelling and just want to get something done. Sometimes, you only want to take an ipad or sometimes you just want to  want to use a low powered device like a raspberry pi as a temrinal, but you don't want to be constrained by installing packages locally on ARM.

Well as luck would have it there's a quick and free workaround available via Oracle Free Tier, Docker and the open source Code Server!
